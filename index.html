                        <h4>1st Monthsary</h4>
                        <p>Months have already since we started our journey,
                            everyday comes with a new challenge and every
                            challenge comes with a new lesson and experience.
                            I can't say that our relationship is perfect but
                            our resilience and perseverance push us to what
                            we are now. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Our neediness help each other to keep us on going
                            forward and look to a new future. We may be an 
                            overthinker but our minds does'nt connect our own 
                            worlds together, it always overlap from each other.
                            However this does'nt stop us from meeting each other
                            in its epicenter.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We may have reach the point of no return even tho our
                            story is just getting started. We may also hurt each 
                            other from time to time but finding the solution was
                            always an option for the both of us, in this story of
                            ours thers's no protagonist or antagonist because it 
                            will be us. I consider you the moon of my dark world
                            and even if the new sun emerge it will never fades
                            away.
